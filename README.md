# Hi, I'm Luca 👋  
Cyber Security student with a passion for C++, C#, system internals, and security testing.

##  About Me
I'm currently studying **Cyber Security at Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg (HBRS)** after completing my education as an **Information Technology Assistant (ITA)**.  

I work on projects involving:
- Low-level C and C++ programming  
- C# / .NET for practical application development  
- Digital cognitive assessment tools  
- Linux and system-level security concepts  
- Privilege escalation and security challenges  

I enjoy understanding how systems behave at a deeper level and solving complex logical problems.

##  Tech Stack
###  Programming
- **C, C++** – core languages, used extensively during ITA  
- **C# / .NET (Windows Forms)** – application and UI development  
- **Arduino (C/C++)** – hardware-related mini projects  

###  Cybersecurity
- Privilege Escalation (Linux & Windows)  
- Linux CLI & Filesystem proficiency  
- TryHackMe labs & hands-on practical challenges  
- Secure coding principles  

##  Highlight Project
### **CAB – Cognitive Amplitude Battery**
A Windows Forms application designed to measure cognitive abilities such as:
- Processing speed  
- Working memory  
- Fluid reasoning  
- Verbal comprehension  

The software uses structured subtests and generates raw scores intended for future standardization.
